Kaanna
======

Kaanna was a small side project that I enjoyed working on for a while. It's a small translator that worked with google's translate API and added a few nice functionality on top of that such as translating with hotkeys and such.

One of the main goals of the project was to be able to make it work on windows and linux both at once. This project never saw the light of day since google deprecated the translation API.

DISCLAIMER: Some of this code was just meant to work and is not pretty at all.
